	* started to replace some of the stdc calls with glibc calls.
	* modified configure.in to look for libxml1 if libxml2 was not found.

<cut from email>.
	I send to you gxmlviewer-1.2.0 patch. With it, 
       	- CDATA and comment display
        - texts like <tag>ff<other>fsdh</other>dd</tag> display correctly, without patch ff and dd text don't display
        - empty tags display like <tag />
        - glib functions replace glibc functions (malloc->g_malloc,...)
</cut from email>
	* almost all .c and .h files were affected in some way.
	* I compiled/tested/verified the changes.
