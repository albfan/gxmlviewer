	* my email has changed, so updated code should reflect this.
	* added color syntax highlighting
	* added extras folder with xmlformatter binary that will take an xml input and "pretty print" it.  Use this with caution since reformatting xml may not be a good idea. 
	* added "gxmlviewer-extras" package for the extra tools
	* the netscape plugin is now in the "gxmlviewer-plugin" package
	* the xmlview-control in now in the "gxmlviewer-bonobo" package
	* configure --without-bonobo will now allow you to build without bonobo installed.  (this is kind of a hack, because i don't know how to properly rebuild the Makefile)
	* syntax highlighting resulted in cleaner parsing/tree building code, but the fact that we are now using labels for each piece of color data adds more processing overhead.  If you are running on a slower hardware you might notice the performance hit.
	* currently you cannot change the default colors of the xmltree but in the future it would be nice if you could get the informat from .Xdefaults or some other sort of resource file.

	* applied diff from Nicholas Marshall <nmarshall@radserver1.2rad.net>
        * diff gave dnd support which worked with Rox filer.
	* modified dnd code to account for Rox with/without hostname in the dnd filename and to support nautilus style dnd.
	* started to replace some of the stdc calls with glibc calls.
	* modified configure.in to look for libxml1 if libxml2 was not found.

<cut from email>.
	I send to you gxmlviewer-1.2.0 patch. With it, 
       	- CDATA and comment display
        - texts like <tag>ff<other>fsdh</other>dd</tag> display correctly, without patch ff and dd text don't display
        - empty tags display like <tag />
        - glib functions replace glibc functions (malloc->g_malloc,...)
</cut from email>
	* almost all .c and .h files were affected in some way.
	* I compiled/tested/verified the changes.
