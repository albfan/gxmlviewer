xmlformatter is a simple xmlformatter. It SHOULD NOT be used as a reliable tool to reformat xml, although it will work in most cases.  Here are the known issues with it...
1. All entities are removed and converted. (ie, &quot; will be ")
2. All whitespace inside and outside of tags are removed and then reformatted. (ie, if whitespace matters in your xmlfile, then don't use this to reformat the xml)

If you simply need a tool to reformat xml in some cases for better readibility within a text editor, then this might be useful.  As a rule of thumb, reformatting xml is not a wise idea, since the whitespace may have been important to begin with.
